                <dt><h3>Favourite Worst Nightmare</h3></dt>
                <dd>The bands second studio album is my favourite. Released in April 2007 and featuring 12 songs. it contains a few of their best songs, such as "Flourescent Adolescent", "Old Yellow Bricks" and "Brainstorm". This album defined their genre at the time, british hard rock, and while their music style has changed over the years its always kept that core, that is so well expressed in this album.</dd>
                <dt><h3>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</h3></dt>
                <dd>The first studio album by Arctic Monkeys. Released on January 2006 and featuring 13 songs. While not as full of hits as their second album, the first one features some heavier tracks like "A Certain Romance", "I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor" and "When The Sun Goes Down". You can tell they didn't want to shorten anything as all the names (including the album name) are very long.</dd>
                <dt><h3>AM</h3></dt>
                <dd>Probably the bands most popular album. Released on September 2013 and featuring 12 songs. After disappearing from the mainstream, this album revitalized the band and made them popular again. While it has a much different music style than their previous albums it features some all-time favourites "Do I Wanna Know?", "R U Mine?" and "I Wanna Be Yours".</dd>
